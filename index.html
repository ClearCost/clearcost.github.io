    <section class="about">
        <p>Clear Cost is a financial solutions company that provides honest pricing for international trade. Our Clear Cost calculator shows the true price of goods before tariffs – something other businesses like Amazon hide. We believe in transparency, helping people see the real cost of what they buy. Simply put, we're against hidden fees and overpriced imports.</p>

            <h2>How It Works</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Enter the Price: Start by entering the total price of your item, including tariffs.</li>
                <li>Select the Country: Choose the country from which the item is being imported.</li>
                <li>Enter the Item Type: Specify the type of item you're importing, as tariffs can vary based on the product category.</li>
                <li>Get the Price Without Tariffs: Our tool will automatically calculate and display the price of your item before tariffs were added, giving you a clear breakdown of the costs.</li>
            </ol>
